# RSvelte -- A compiler written in rust for Svelte
RSvelte (stands for Rust Svelte, also stands for Re-Svelte) is a utility to reimplement Svelte fast and security in Rust.

Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app. https://svelte.dev/
